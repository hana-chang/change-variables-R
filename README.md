# How To Create Change Variables in R
Change variables are very simple to create yet powerful for predictive models. An individual's historical behavior can be captured best when you use change variables. It could be useful for for a customer churn model where monitoring a change in the state of a customer is important. We can also avoid a problem of standardization when we use change variables over absolute variables. For example, one unit change for a customer with a revenue of $10 is greater than one unit change for a customer with $1,000. 

In this module, we will create rolling sum and change variables using function in R.
